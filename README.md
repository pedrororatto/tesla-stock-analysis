#   Tesla Stock Analysis

This project is an interactive application developed in Python for analyzing historical Tesla stock data. The main objective is to provide financial insights through descriptive statistics, statistical tests, and graphical visualizations, as well as to simulate the evolution of an investment based on a user-selected purchase date.

##   üéØ Features

-   **Descriptive Statistics**:
    -   Mean, Median, Mode, Variance, Standard Deviation, and Mean Absolute Deviation of closing prices.
    -   Interactive histogram of prices.

-   **Student's t-test**:
    -   Comparison of the average closing prices with a hypothetical value to determine statistical significance.

-   **Prediction with Linear Regression**:
    -   Linear regression model to predict future stock prices.

-   **Investment Evolution**:
    -   Simulation of investment growth from a purchase date, considering accumulated returns over time.

-   **Total sales volume per year and month**:
    -   Example graph of sales over the year and per month.

-   **Buy and sell indicators**:
    -   Based on historical data, indicates when it was good to buy and when it was better to sell.

-   **Correlation between price and volume**
    -   Correlation graph between these two variables.
